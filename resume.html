            <span class="tab"></span>Overall, my experience in the course was amazing. The lectures were very
            informative, and Professor Navreet did a
            great job explaining the different concepts. I was able to grasp the learning material quickly because the
            lectures were taught in a way that
            can help even a beginner with no prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The assignments also just
            further enhanced the amount of material
            I was able to learn with a more hands-on approach. Not only did the assignments help with me taking the
            concepts learned in class and applying
            them on VS Code but it also helped with visualizing what my code was doing. I was able to see what each line
            of code was doing to my website and
            where to fix an error if there was one.<br>
            A few concepts that I learned in this course include, creating a website that can
            alert and prompt a user for values,
            website design such as the layout and responsiveness, also how to create a form that can ask the user to
            input values and submit it.
